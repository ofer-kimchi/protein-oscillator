Code to accompany Kimchi et al. Sci. Adv. 2020

This repository contains code that was used to generate the results and figures in Kimchi et al. Sci. Adv. 2020. All results and methodologies are presented in the paper. 

Most figures are created in the file upload_oscillation_paper_figures.py. The other .py files are used to generate the data to create these figures. These data have also been uploaded to this repository. The .ipynb files are used to generate the robustness and amplitude analyses described in the supplemental info.

Any questions can be directed to Ofer Kimchi at okimchi@princeton.edu
